Changes in Version 1.0-1

  o Function hmmm.chibar can now handle also mph models and the function chibar has been deleted 


  o Fixed bugs in hmmm.model.X, loglin.model and summary.mphfit


  o Modified the function hidden.emfit to allow the use of more than one latent variable. The new function enables to define the marginal models for observed and latent variables using hmmm.model and hmmm.model.X 
 

  o Updated few examples in the help files and in the demo 


  o Revised the tutorial file


Changes in Version 1.0-2

 o Function akaike for selecting models is added

 o A new dataset is inserted

 o Function hmmm.chibar now has new arguments to handle also a new type of test and to calculate exact weights for the chi-bar distribution 

 o Modified the convergence criterium for the estimates in the function hidden.emfit

 o Revised the tutorial file


Changes in Version 1.0-3

o Revised the tutorial file 

o Modified Citation file 


Changes in Version 1.0-4

o Function GMI to compute generalized marginal interactions is added

o Function inv_GMI to compute a vector of joint probabilities from a vector of generalized marginal interactions is added

o Fixed bugs in hmmm.chibar
